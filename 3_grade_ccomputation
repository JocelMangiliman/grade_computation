# these are the given grades, you will indiccate the prelim grade, midterm grade, and the final grade.
pgrade = 80
mgrade = 75
fgrade = 88

# this will calculate the average grade of a students using the formula average is equals to prelim grade x 0.3 + midterm gradex 0.3 + final grade but this time x 0.4
ave = pgrade * 0.3 + mgrade * 0.3 + fgrade * 0.4


# this line will then display the average grade of the student 
print("The average grade is:", ave)
